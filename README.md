# Get Me Employed

User Story
- I am looking for a new job
- I am tired of searcing across multiple platforms and seeing the same listings over and over again
- I would like to save jobs I am interested in

Features
- The web page "Get me Employed" provides a user with a clear and clean experience, that allows them to search for jobs across a couple of platforms in one place.
- The web page allows the user to favourite a job of interest, which is then placed in their saved jobs tab. 
- If a user is no longer interested in a saved job, they may click the star again to unfavourite it. 
- The search bar allows a user to enter multiple parameters such as job title, location, type.
- If the user were to close the web page and return later, their favourited jobs will still remain in the saved jobs tab.
